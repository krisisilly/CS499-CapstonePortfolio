This video provides an overview of my original artifacts and outlines my enhancement plans for the CS-405 Secure Coding, CS-300 Data Structures & Algorithms, and CS-340 Client/Server Development projects. It demonstrates how these artifacts were selected to represent growth in software design, algorithmic reasoning, and database integration.
