# Artifact 3 – CS-340 Client/Server Development

### Overview
This enhancement originates from **CS-340: Client/Server Development** and demonstrates the integration of a full-stack application using **Python Flask** and **MongoDB**.  
The goal of this enhancement was to strengthen security, efficiency, and maintainability within the existing Animal Shelter web application by improving CRUD functionality, database handling, and code structure.

### Original Artifact
The original program (`animal_shelter_original.py`) provided basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using MongoDB but lacked proper indexing, secure connection handling, and modularity.

### Enhanced Artifact
The enhanced version (`animal_shelter.py`) introduces:
- MongoDB indexing for faster database queries  
- Environment variable configuration for secure connection credentials  
- Refactored CRUD methods with error handling and cleaner modularization  
- Optimized Flask integration for improved client/server interaction  
- Improved readability and maintainability following Pythonic best practices

### Reflection
This enhancement demonstrates my ability to design and improve database-driven applications that integrate front-end and back-end systems securely.  
Through this work, I implemented advanced MongoDB concepts such as indexing, optimized query patterns, and proper error handling.  

I also applied security-conscious development practices, replacing hard-coded credentials with environment variables and ensuring robust, modular Flask application architecture.

Key accomplishments include:
- Implementing secure database connections and best practices for data privacy  
- Enhancing CRUD efficiency through indexing and optimized queries  
- Refactoring the project for scalability and maintainability

### Course Outcomes Demonstrated
- Design and evaluate computing solutions leveraging databases and client/server frameworks.  
- Employ secure and efficient database management techniques using modern frameworks.  
- Develop professional full-stack applications that demonstrate integrated problem solving and security awareness.
