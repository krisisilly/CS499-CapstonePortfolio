# Artifact 2 – CS-300 Data Structures & Algorithms: Analysis & Design Enhancement

### Overview
This enhancement comes from **CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
The enhancement involved analyzing and improving algorithm performance and efficiency through refactoring and benchmarking.  
The goal of this enhancement was to apply algorithmic design principles to improve time complexity, maintain clean and modular code, and document empirical results through benchmarking.

### Reflection
This enhancement demonstrates my ability to optimize algorithmic efficiency using proper data structures and performance benchmarking.  
I evaluated time complexity and used algorithmic design to enhance both runtime and maintainability.  

The refactoring process reinforced my understanding of algorithmic scalability, computational complexity, and the value of empirical testing in validating design decisions.

Key accomplishments include:
- Implementing and benchmarking advanced algorithms  
- Enhancing efficiency through improved data structures  
- Refactoring legacy code for clarity and performance

### Course Outcomes Demonstrated
- Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and data structure best practices.  
- Apply analytical reasoning to assess performance and trade-offs between different algorithms.  
- Develop professional-quality code that is efficient, readable, and well-documented.
